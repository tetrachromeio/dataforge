**Privacy Compliance & Data Usage Summary**  
The provided analytics system collects user data for performance monitoring and behavioral analytics. Here's a breakdown of key privacy considerations and policy requirements:

---

### **Key Data Collected**
1. **Mandatory Tracking (Without Consent):**
   - Anonymized pageviews (URL only)
   - Timestamp

2. **With Cookie Consent:**
   - Full URL
   - User agent
   - Screen resolution
   - Page load performance metrics
   - Event interactions (clicks, element details)
   - Mouse coordinates
   - Session visibility changes
   - IP address (anonymized via parsing/validation)

---

### **Privacy Compliance Requirements**
1. **GDPR (EU):**
   - Requires explicit cookie consent via mechanisms like banners
   - Must provide data access/deletion requests
   - IP addresses qualify as personal data under Art. 4(1)

2. **CCPA (California):**
   - Users must opt out of data sales (if applicable)
   - Disclosure of collected data categories

3. **Global Best Practices:**
   - Data minimization (truncated fields, limited retention)
   - Security measures (SSL, rate limiting, input sanitization)

---

### **Privacy Policy Essentials**
1. **Data Collection Disclosure:**
   - List all collected data types (URLs, events, performance metrics)
   - Specify anonymized vs. identified data

2. **Purpose Specification:**
   - Explain usage: analytics, UX optimization, error monitoring

3. **Cookie Policy:**
   - Describe the `cookies_accepted` cookie (1-year duration)
   - Explain consent revocation instructions

4. **Third-Party Sharing:**
   - Disclose if analytics data is shared externally (not shown in code)

5. **Retention Period:**
   - Define storage duration (e.g., "12 months from last visit")

6. **User Rights:**
   - Access requests
   - Data deletion process
   - Consent withdrawal mechanism

7. **Security Measures:**
   - Encryption (HTTPS, database SSL)
   - Rate limiting
   - IP anonymization techniques

8. **Contact Information:**
   - Provide email/address for privacy inquiries

---

### **Implementation Recommendations**
1. Add a cookie consent banner with granular controls
2. Implement data retention policies (auto-delete old records)
3. Document procedures for user data requests
4. Conduct periodic Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)

This system demonstrates foundational compliance through anonymization and consent checks but requires explicit policy disclosures to meet global standards.
